Leo : I think you're referring to a chatbot framework that utilizes Python, machine learning, and deep learning. There are several frameworks that fit this description, but one popular one that comes to mind is Rasa.
Rasa is an open-source conversational AI framework that allows developers to build contextual chatbots and voice assistants. It uses machine learning and deep learning to understand and respond to user inputs. Rasa is built on top of Python and provides a flexible and scalable platform for building conversational interfaces.
Is this the one you were thinking of, or is there another framework you had in mind?
